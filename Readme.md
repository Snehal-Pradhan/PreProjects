Task List: GitHub Profile Data Scraper

1. Set Up the Project Environment
   Initialize Node.js Project
   Set up a new Node.js project with npm init.
   Install Dependencies
   Install necessary packages:
   express for creating the server.
   axios for making API requests.
   dotenv for managing environment variables securely.
2. Set Up GitHub Personal Access Token
   Create GitHub Personal Access Token
   Go to GitHub settings and generate a personal access token with the read:user scope.
   Store Token in .env File
   Securely store your GitHub token in the .env file to be used in API requests.
3. Create Basic Server Setup
   Set Up Express Server
   Create a simple Express server with basic routing.
   Set up the server to listen on a specified port.
4. Implement GitHub API Integration
   Create a Function to Fetch GitHub Profile Data
   Use Axios to send GET requests to GitHub’s API for user profile data.
   Extract relevant fields like username, name, bio, followers, and location.
   Create a Function to Fetch GitHub Repository Data
   Use Axios to send GET requests to GitHub’s API for a user’s public repositories.
   Extract relevant fields like repository name, description, stars, forks, and language.
5. Set Up API Routes
   Create a Route for Fetching Profile Data
   Implement a GET route (/api/github-profile/:username) to retrieve GitHub profile details using the username.
   Create a Route for Fetching Repository Data
   Implement a GET route (/api/github-repos/:username) to retrieve public repositories of the specified user.
6. Error Handling and Validation
   Validate Input
   Ensure that the GitHub username provided in the request is valid.
   Handle API Errors
   Implement error handling for API failures (e.g., rate-limiting, invalid username).
   Handle Edge Cases
   Consider edge cases, like a user with no repositories or missing profile details.
7. Test the API Endpoints
   Test Profile Fetching Endpoint
   Use tools like Postman to test the /api/github-profile/:username endpoint and validate that profile data is being returned correctly.
   Test Repository Fetching Endpoint
   Test the /api/github-repos/:username endpoint to ensure the correct repository details are fetched.
8. Documentation
   Write Project Documentation
   Create a README.md file explaining the purpose of the project, tech stack, setup instructions, and how to use the API.
   Document API Endpoints
   Include detailed information about the API endpoints and their expected inputs/outputs in the documentation.
9. Version Control
   Set Up Git Repository
   Initialize a Git repository for version control and push it to GitHub.
   Commit Changes
   Commit your changes regularly with meaningful messages.
10. Deployment (Optional)
    Deploy the Application
    Deploy your app to a platform like Heroku or Vercel.
    Test the deployed app to ensure it works as expected in a production environment.
    Future Enhancements (Optional)
    Caching Data
    Implement caching to store frequently requested data and reduce unnecessary API calls to GitHub.
    Rate Limit Handling
    Handle GitHub’s API rate limits and ensure users receive appropriate messages if they exceed the limit.
    Add Additional Data Fields
    Enhance the profile and repository data to include more detailed fields, such as topics, commits, or contributors.
